## API Principles and Guidelines

### API Program

Snyk's API program aims to maximize the value we provide to developers and the extensibility of the Snyk platform through APIs. 

Read more about the Snyk [API Program](principles/api_program.md).

### JSON API

[JSON API](https://jsonapi.org/) is an emerging industry standard for representing RESTful resources as JSON data. JSON API's innovation is it's normalization of how entities are expressed, represented, structured, and how these entities relate to each other.

We at Snyk found JSON API to be an excellent starting point for a resource-based API, formatting and structuring JSON data in requests and responses. Leveraging JSON API's opinionated choices enabled us to focus more on designing and building the actual content of the Snyk API.

Read how Snyk has adopted and adapted [JSON API](principles/jsonapi.md) into the Snyk API program.
